# Analysis on GLH (Guided Learning Hours) in Further Education and Sixth Form Colleges in the UK using SAS

This project analyzes variations in Guided Learning Hours (GLH) per learner across two types of UK educational institutions: Further Education Colleges and Sixth Form Colleges. The goal is to identify significant trends and correlations by examining factors such as institution type, size, region, and historical data over three years. This analysis utilizes SAS (Statistical Analysis System) tools and techniques, following a structured approach:

- Data Import and Preparation
- Data Cleaning and Modification
- Anomalies Detection and Handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Modeling

The results aim to provide data-driven insights for optimizing GLH allocation and improving resource management in educational institutions.

GLH refers to the time a student spends being taught or instructed in a structured learning environment. Further education colleges provide education for students aged 16 and older, often focusing on vocational and technical courses, while sixth form colleges primarily cater to students aged 16 to 19, offering academic qualifications such as A-levels. 



## Dataset Description

The analysis is based on two datasets containing information on the total Guided Learning Hours (GLH) for learners across various regions of the UK.
Both datasets are structured similarly but focus on different types of institutions. 

we have 2 CSV files, Dataset 1 contains 'Further Education Colleges' data and Dataset 2 contains 'Sixth Form Colleges' data. 

These datasets contains data for 9 regions across 3 years. The regions covered in this dataset include:

- East Midlands
- East of England
- London
- North East
- North West
- South East
- South West
- West Midlands
- Yorkshire and the Humber

The datasets consists of 8 columns:

- Type of Institution: Further Education (FE) or Sixth form colleges
- Region: Specifies the geographical region of the institution.
- Total GLH (Guided Learning Hours) Year 1 : Represents the number of hours spent on teaching and learning activities.
- Number of Learners Year 1 : The count of learners in the educational institutions for the given year and region.
- Total GLH Year 2
- Number of Learners Year 2
- Total GLH Year 3
- Number of Learners Year 3

## Major Insights üìä
The analysis primarily focuses on examining guided learning hours per learner concerning various factors, such as region, institution type, size, and three-year data for each institute. It identifies an inverse relationship between the institute type and size with the total guided learning hours needed. However, an interesting contradiction is observed in small-size institutes, where sixth form colleges, despite being more numerous, require higher GLH (guided learning hours) for a single learner than FE colleges' learners.

## Methods Implemented üõ†Ô∏è
### 1. Data Import üì•
   - Commands utilized: DATA, INFILE, DSD, DLM, FIRSTOBS, MISSOVER, INFORMAT, INPUT, LABEL, SET, IF statement, PROC PRINT, etc.
### 2. Data Cleaning üßπ
   - Handle missing values
   - Calculate average GLH for three years
   - Introduce variables: Average Glh hours, Glh per learner, Total Glh per learner, Size (of the institute)
### 3. Anomalies Detection and Handling üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
   - Identify extreme values in the data
   - Normalize data using log transformation
### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìä
   - Summarize dependent and independent variables
   - Analyze GLH per learner by institute type and size, effect of region and year on GLH per learner

## Results  üìù
The detailed analysis presents significant findings:

- Effect of Institute Type and Size on GLH per learner

‚Ä¢	Summarizing the above information, we can state that there is an inverse relationship between the institute type and size with the total GL hours needed. However, we find a contrary in small-size institutes, though sixth form colleges are more in number high GL hours needed for a single learner than FE colleges learner.

  
- Effect of Region and Year on GLH per learner

‚Ä¢	Summarizing the above information, we can say that a few regions needed more learning hours in year 3 but some decreased in the 3rd year. Every region had low learning hours needed in year 1.


- Effect of Institute Type on GLH per learner

The scatter plot shows that there is a variation in the two groups and sixth form college has low variance. The box plot depicts the data to median and mean overlap in FE colleges and half of the data in sixth form li below the median. 
‚Ä¢ Summarizing the above results state that there is a difference between the two variables and FE colleges mean is greater than Further education college by 1.06 as this may be due to lack of data of the sixth form colleges.

There are 9 regions where the colleges are spread among which ‚ÄòSouth East‚Äô and ‚ÄòNorth West‚Äô regions have a higher number of observations and the scatter plot shows that ‚ÄòEast Midlands‚Äô and ‚ÄòSouth West‚Äô regions there are a minimum number of observations. And the box plot shows that the mean for each region is above the median and they do not overlap except for ‚ÄòSouth West‚Äô region. 


##  Conclusions üìù

We can conclude that there is an inverse relationship between the institute type and size with the total GL hours needed. However, we find a contrary in small-size institutes, though sixth form colleges are more in number high GL hours needed for a single learner than FE colleges learner. When region and year are taken into consideration few regions needed more learning hours in year 3 but some decreased in the 3rd year also every region had low learning hours needed in year 1. The statistical models show a significant relationship between all the factors in each group and there are few combinations high correlation is found but there is no normality in the data.
